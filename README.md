# Moonquake

---

NASA Moonquake 2.0 Challange created for NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2023. 

## Team
We are a team of space engineers from Berlin with limited to no idea in coding and through this challange we wanted to learn about coding, its languages, hackathon culture and much more. Our goal was to create a 3D structure of the Moon and give it to everyone for learning and growing, this is also aimed for space engineers designing a space mission who want to 3D visualize data.


## Challenge
When they explored the Moon, NASA’s Apollo astronauts left behind several instruments to collect geophysical data near each Apollo landing site. Your challenge is to develop an app for the public that plots the seismic data these instruments transmitted back to Earth on an interactive 3-D digital moon globe.

## Resources
Some of the data has been taken from NASA public forum websites like

  -  Apollo Seismic Event Catalog from NASA’s Planetary Data System (PDS)
  -  NASA Apollo 11 Passive Seismic Experiment (part of EASEP package)

Also the code is influenced by the works of Eduayme from Github - https://github.com/eduayme/moonquake
